# UZH-DAO

Welcome to the DAO project implemented by the UZH BCC community!

## Overview

The DAO project implemented by the UZH BCC community is an open-source platform for decentralized decision-making based on blockchain technology.It empowers members of the community to create proposals and vote on them, allowing for a decentralized and democratic decision-making process.

The platform is built on top of an Ethereum fork operated by the Blockchain Center of the University of Zurich (UZH). The platform uses smart contracts to ensure secure and reliable execution of the voting. The DAO tokens are used to represent voting power in the organization.
